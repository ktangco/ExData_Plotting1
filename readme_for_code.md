### Points to note when running the plotn.R codes (not required for assignment, just FYI) ###

1.  Assumes that your computer has enough memory to store the original data set and load/manipulate in R.

2.  Assumes that the original data set is in the working directory and has been unzipped.

3.  The following packages need to be installed:  
        - dplyr  
        - lubridate
